                We push each other to be the best. It’s not uncommon for one of us to say ‘this needs to be better, back
                to the drawing
                board’”<br> - Lead vocalist of The Bees Knees
            </p>
            <h3>The Bee Knees</h3>
            <p>
                The Bees Knees is a pop rock band originating from San Francisco, California. The band consists a
                dynamic lineup
                featuring two lead vocalists, two guitarists, a bassist, a keyboardist and a drummer. The band achieved
                its first
                commercial success as an unsigned act, drawing attention from their future manager. Having extensive
                experience working
                with both new and seasoned acts, the manager was confident the band could succeed even further with more
                support,
                pushing The Bees Knees to sign with a well known record label.
            </p>
            <p>
                From there, the band has soared, gaining international recognition and ranking in the top 10 on the
                Poster Charts. New
                fans immediately fell in love with the band’s original and organic attitude, solidifying their place as
                one of the
                hottest and fastest up and coming acts of this century. Fans affectionately refer to themselves as “The
                Hive” and are
                drawn to their candid and authentic performances on stage. The Bees Knees are currently recording their
                second studio
                album, looking to be released in early 2024.
